I love finding solutions to tough problems and use a multi-disciplinary approach. Some of my specialties are physics, coding, fusion energy, material science, optics, imaging, spectroscopy, optimizing processes, photography, and riding waves (oh yeah!). I like to strike a balance between big-picture thinking, attention to detail, and risk taking.

Hi, thanks for visiting. I grew up in Southern California and as a kid I decided to pursue surfing. No regrets there, as riding waves is therapy for my soul.

I am currently working on deep neural networks to solve tough problems, including analysis of nuclear reactions from energetic ion beams used to diagnose materials. For the past 10+ years I've been working on the development of fusion energy as a viable energy source using magnetically confined plasmas. 

My research spans a range of challenges, from magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in the hot plasma core, to transiet behavior in the plasma edge, to understanding the interaction between plasmas and materials. I was the first to achieve plasma images of many phenomena including ultra-fast electrons moving near the speed of light. I worked on understanding how various materials handle intense heat from fusion plasmas, how fusion fuel becomes trapped in material, and how to both release and measure the trapped fuel using controlled laser heating and optical spectroscopy.

Education:  Ph.D. in plasma physics from U.C. San Diego, M.S. in plasma physics from U.C. San Diego, B.A. in physics from U.C. Berkeley.

I've published nearly 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals, traveled around the world giving talks and presentations, and collaborated with dozens of scientists. I've worked at multiple research locations including three universities, two private companies, three goverment laboratories, and started a software development company. I'm always interested in learning new things and would love to hear how I can help you, your company, or organization.

I once recorded a high-speed movie of one of the most extreme temperature differences in our solar system: a cryogenic pellet of hydrogen with a temperature of -452 F was shot into a hot plasma with a temperature of about 200 million degrees, which is hotter than the sun! That experiment was affectionately called "a snowball in hell," and its purpose was to see if fusion plasmas could be re-fuelled on the fly.

My work requires generating, analyzing, and coding for a variety of data, so classic data analysis and what is now considered basic machine learning are a big part of what I do.

Iâ€™ve traveled to every continent except Antarctica. I love surfing and have ridden waves in 13 countries, my favorite being Indonesia because of the warm people, beautiful landscapes, and incredible quality of waves.

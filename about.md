Hi, thanks for visiting. I grew up in Southern California and as a kid I decided to pursue surfing. No regrets there, as riding waves is therapy for my soul and it sparked a curiosity about how the world works.

I've been voraciously curious ever since, and I'm currently working on deep neural networks to solve tough problems, including analysis of nuclear reactions from energetic ion beams used to diagnose materials. For the past 10+ years I've been working on the development of fusion energy as a viable energy source using magnetically confined plasmas. 

My research has spanned a range of challenges, from quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, to investigating magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in the hot plasma core, to understanding the interaction between plasmas and materials. I was the first to achieve plasma images of many phenomena including ultra-fast electrons moving near the speed of light. I've published over 90 articles in peer-reviewed journals, traveled around the world giving talks and presentations, and collaborated with dozens of scientists. I'm always interested in learning new things and would love to hear how I can help you, your company, or organization.

I once recorded a high-speed movie of one of the most extreme temperature differences in our solar system: a cryogenic pellet of hydrogen with a temperature of -452 &deg;F was shot into a hot plasma with a temperature of about 200 million &deg;F, which is hotter than the sun! That experiment was affectionately called "a snowball in hell," which was done to investigate if fusion plasmas could be re-fuelled on the fly.

Iâ€™ve traveled to every continent except Antarctica. I love surfing and have ridden waves in 13 countries, my favorite being Indonesia because of the warm people, beautiful landscapes, and incredible quality of waves.

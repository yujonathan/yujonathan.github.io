### The question

Why does time have an arrow? After all, nearly all the laws of physics are time-reversible, that is, the equations of motion are valid if you run time forward **or** backward. Nothing in classical physics prevents a series of events running in reverse. For example, if you drop a glass cup on the floor and it shatters into little pieces, physics describes the motion of all the atoms equally well for either direction of time. On a macroscopic level, entropy (disorder) increases after the glass breaks, but there is still no physical law preventing all the little pieces reforming a whole cup again. This reversal is extremely unlikely because all the particles would need to follow exact trajectories in phase space, but it **is** possible. So based on classical physics, there is no preferred direction for the flow of time!

The first wave is launched at t = 0 and the second wave with higher mode number (shorter wavelength) is launched at t = tau. The third wave at t = 2tau appears spontaneously due to the reversal of the first wave damping, and this third wave is the echo. The bottom figures show the experimental density (or fluid vorticity) perturbation at eight successive times, corresponding to the times marked in the top figure.

Why then does time move inexorably forward? Well, this is a deep question and some of the greatest minds in history have tried to explain it. One idea from Boltzmann is called *molecular chaos*, which states the momenta of two particles are uncorrelated both before and after a collision. This assumption led to Boltzmann's H-theorem, which predicts an increase in entropy until equilibrium is reached. Entropy does increase and this corresponds to our everyday notion of time moving in one direction. But the assumption of molecular chaos remains unproven and may not be true. In fact, Loschmidt objected to Boltzmann's idea because it should not lead to an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics (Loschmidt's paradox). Other formalisms dealing with time's arrow and the second law of thermodynamics include the Poincare recurrence theorem, and a crazy hypothetical thing called Maxwell's demon.

The electron plasma is slammed into a phosphor screen at various times throughout the experiment, which is imaged with a CCD camera. This destroys the plasma, but by creating the same initial plasma and holding it for various durations, a movie can be created.

### The results

Let's move on to what I did: for the first time ever, I explicity demonstrated reversible wave damping in a pure electron plasma (see Figure 2). These waves are identical to vorticity waves in a 2-dimensional fluid (also called Kelvin waves). My demonstration of reversibility is both beautiful and intriguing, largely because there are so few examples of reversibility in nature (yet as we know, physical equations of motion **are** reversible). It turns out the wave information is stored in a spiral structure within the electron cloud, and this information is recovered by "unwinding" the spiral. The method of unwinding is unique because it's achieved by launching a second wave in the electron plasma.
